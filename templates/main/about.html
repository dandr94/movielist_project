                        MovieList allows you to create custom named Lists with a cover of your choice!
                        After you can search for a Movie that you watched and add it to the List.
                        You can have a lot of Lists, and you can divide your Movies however you want.
                        Or you can make a List for example 'Completed' and have all movies that you
                        watched in it!

                        MovieList search results are provided by <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">TMDB API</a>
                        and Trailers are generated by <a>YOUTUBE API!</a>. This project is still work in progress, so It may have a lot of bugs. It's my first project so there
                        is a lot to be learned still, but I will continue to make it better!
                        Movie List is free, It doesn't run any ads, and It will remain that way.
                        There is zero revue generated by this site.
